## 🏗️ Stone, Scanned and Strategized

Gone are the days of brute-force chiseling and one-size-fits-none quarrying. This AI-driven monument maker combines **geological scanning** and **robotic carving** to read natural stone like a blueprint—producing **precision-cut blocks** tailored for pyramids, temples, sculptures, and sacred geometry.

## 🧠 Material Intelligence Meets Megalithic Vision

Using embedded LIDAR, density probes, and mineral analysis, the system maps:
- Grain flow and fracture lines  
- Vein patterns and impurities  
- Core density and structural load capacity

### 🧱 Smart Block Output Options
Choose your project goals, and let the system auto-generate ideal stone outputs:
- **Pyramid-grade bricks**: Uniform angles, weight-balanced  
- **Obelisks & steles**: Stability-optimized for upright installation  
- **Interlocking puzzle stones**: Machined for friction-fit megastructures  
- **Artistic pieces**: Suggests carving orientations based on natural veining

## 🔺 Pyramid-Perfect Geometry

Dreaming of a backyard ziggurat or sacred stone altar? This tool makes it plausible:

### Geometry You Can Trust
- **Golden-angle face cuts**: Dial in sacred ratios like φ (1.618) or 2π  
- **Mortise & tenon joints**: Seamless dry-fit locking systems  
- **Auto-balancing**: Shape stones to stabilize when stacked—no mortar required

### Alignment Assistant
- AR overlays help align your build with **solar, lunar, or cardinal** directions  
- Auto-generates stacking plans and load-bearing simulations

## 🪨 Block by Block: Project Examples

| Project Type           | Output Features                              | Est. Value Per Stone |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Mini Pyramid Kit**   | 13–91 blocks, base to apex ratio tuning       | $800–$5,000          |
| **Altar Slab**         | Vein-aligned top, reinforced base edge cuts   | $500–$1,500          |
| **Monolithic Bench**   | Ergonomic seating surface, anti-wobble base   | $600+                |
| **Sculpture Starter**  | Pre-shaped form based on natural outlines     | $300–$2,000+         |

## ⚙️ From Boulder to Blueprint: The Workflow

1. **Scan the Stone**
   - Multi-sensor suite captures grain, internal flaws, and vein flow  
   - AI identifies what geometry the rock is “meant” to be

2. **Select Output Goal**
   - Pyramid, sculpture, altar, obelisk, interlocking puzzle  
   - App suggests best-fit design or imports custom models

3. **Generate Cut Plan**
   - Toolpath renders in 3D—visible via mobile app or AR headset  
   - Estimate total usable volume and project ROI

4. **Engage Carving System**
   - Robotic arms with diamond-tipped saws, polishers, and chisels  
   - Auto-adjusts force and angle based on real-time feedback

5. **Place or Sell**
   - Stones stamped with QR codes linking to material origin and cut specs  
   - Market your unique blocks to artists, builders, or museums

## 🌍 Built to Last, Cut With Intention

| Factor                  | How AI Optimizes It                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Material Waste**      | Maximize usable volume, minimize runoff      |
| **Structural Integrity**| Avoids fractures and weak seams              |
| **Transport Efficiency**| Recommends breakpoints for modular hauling   |
| **Design Precision**    | Micron-level cuts for legacy construction    |
| **Energy Usage**        | Predictive carving paths reduce motor strain |
