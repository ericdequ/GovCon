Conventional solar panels treat the suns white light as one uniform input, but the solar spectrum spans from ultraviolet through infrared—each band demanding different semiconductor materials for optimal conversion. **PrismPanel** employs microscopic optical prisms and dichroic coatings to **tease apart the rainbow**, routing violet, blue, green, red, and near‑IR light to **dedicated PV cells** tuned for that wavelength. The result? A dramatic boost in overall efficiency, harvesting more energy from every sunbeam.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Micro‑Prism Optical Layer**  
   - A transparent cover of sub‑millimeter triangular prisms refracts incoming sunlight, angularly separating it into distinct color bands.  
   - Each prism is aligned so that specific wavelengths exit at designed angles, creating narrow spectral “fans” beneath the panel.

2. **Dichroic Mirror Array**  
   - Beneath the prisms, a series of dielectric multilayer mirrors reflects only a target wavelength band toward its matching cell, while transmitting the rest onward to successive mirrors.  
   - This cascading mirror approach minimizes loss and crosstalk between spectrum bands.

3. **Tailored PV Sub‑Modules**  
   - **Ultra‑violet cells** (wide‑bandgap III–V semiconductors) convert high‑energy photons efficiently.  
   - **Blue/green cells** use perovskite layers finely tuned for those mid‑spectrum bands.  
   - **Red/IR cells** leverage silicon heterojunction and thin‑film CIGS for deep‑red and near‑infrared absorption.

4. **Integrated Heat Recovery**  
   - Infrared‑rich spectrum that passes through all PV stages is captured by a thermal backsheet, feeding a low‑grade heat exchanger for water pre‑heating or building heating.

5. **Smart Balance‑of‑System**  
   - A microcontroller synchronizes maximum power‑point tracking (MPPT) per sub‑module, ensuring each spectral channel outputs at peak efficiency regardless of overall panel loading.

## ⚖️ Technical & Economic Considerations

- **Manufacturing Complexity:** Precision optics and multilayer coatings add steps—but leveraging roll‑to‑roll UV‑casting can drive costs down over volume.  
- **Durability & Weatherproofing:** Optical layers are coated with self‑cleaning, anti‑UV films to prevent soiling and haze over decades.  
- **Thermal Management:** Integrated heat exchangers require building‑oriented plumbing—but unlock valuable co‑generation opportunities.  
- **Balance‑of‑System Integration:** Multi‑MPPT microinverters per panel add capital cost but reduce mismatch losses in partial‑shade conditions.

## 💡 From the Founder: Harvesting the Full Spectrum

> “Sunlight isn’t monochrome—it’s a rainbow of energy waiting to be unlocked.  
> PrismPanel tears apart that spectrum and feeds each color to the semiconductor that loves it most.  
> When we stop forcing all photons into one generic cell, we unleash solar conversion like never before.”
